# ESP8266 WiFi HTTP Client

This is an example  showing how to connect to the access point and send a simple http post/get request to the web server.
In order to compile and burn the program i have used [esp-open-sdk](https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos)  and [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) from espressif.
More details about how to build a project you can find [here](https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos/blob/master/README.md) and [here](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/resources)

If you had done all of it just copy the project and change the path to common.mk file
...
include your_path/common.mk
